# SyncG

SyncG is a tool designed for generating synthetic datasets. This repository provides both pre-built datasets and the original scripts to generate your own customized data.

## üíæ Pre-built Dataset

A pre-built dataset is available for immediate use. You can download all the necessary files from the Hugging Face repository:

*   **[Download the dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YihengDeng/syncG/tree/main)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Dataset Generation

For those who wish to create their own datasets tailored to specific needs, we provide the original generation scripts. The entire process is designed to run headlessly.

Here is a step-by-step guide to get you started.

### 1. Prerequisites: Blender Environment

We recommend using Docker for a consistent and clean environment.

* **Pull the Blender Docker image:**

  ```bash
  docker pull linuxserver/blender:4.1.1
  ```

* **Install Python dependencies:**
  Once the container is running, use the following command to install the required Python libraries within Blender's Python environment:

  ```bash
  /blender/4.1/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install opencv-python
  ```

### 2. HDRI Files

High-Dynamic Range Image (HDRI) files are used for scene lighting.

*   Upload your HDRI files (which typically have a `.hdr` extension) to the `scene_file` folder.
*   A collection of pre-selected HDRIs is available for download at the same [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YihengDeng/syncG/tree/main).

### 3. Configuration (`data_config.json`)

The `data_config.json` file contains the primary parameters for the generation process. Pay close attention to the following arguments:

*   `project_root`: The absolute path to the main project folder. Ensure the `scene_file` and `blender_project` folders are located under this root directory.
*   `dataset_name`: A unique name for your generated dataset.

### 4. Script Setup

You'll need to configure the paths within the generation scripts.

* **In `generate_syncG.py`:**
  On line 896, update the `config_path` variable to point to the actual location of your `data_config.json` file.

* **In `generate.sh`:**
  Update the paths for the Blender project file (`/syncG/blender_project/fakemeter_oil_new.blend`) and the script file (`/syncG/scripts/scripts_clean.py`) to reflect their actual locations on your system.

* **Link the script:**
  It is recommended to link (or move) the `generate.sh` script to the `/blender` directory inside your container for easier execution.

  ```bash
  # Create a symbolic link
  ln -s /path/to/your/generate.sh /blender/generate.sh
  ```

### 5. Running the Generation

Once everything is configured, you can start the generation process.

* **Navigate to the Blender directory:**

  ```bash
  cd /blender
  ```

* **Execute the script:**

  ```bash
  bash generate.sh
  ```
